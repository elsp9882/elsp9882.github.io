## Bio
I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I studied mathematics and philosophy. My master's degree is in economics from the University of Texas at Austin. I'm heading into my fourth year of a PhD in economics at the University of Washington in Seattle. 

## Academic Interests

Within the field of economics, I'm interested in macroeconomics. Specifically, I'm interested in monetary economics, international finance, and macro-finance. I've been conducting research on monetary policy matters for the last few years, and I'm currently working on research related to the fiscal theory of the price level.

In addition to economics, I'm fascinated by political science, law, history, and philosophy.

Besides English, I also speak German fluently and have been studying it for about ten years.

## Hobbies

When I have the time, I enjoy playing music. I've played guitar most of my life.

I also love the outdoors. The picture at the top of this page is of me at the summit of North Maroon Peak in Aspen, CO. I've climbed several of the "14ers" in Colorado and try to "bag" one of them each year. 

I live in Bellevue, WA with my wonderful wife Kendall.
