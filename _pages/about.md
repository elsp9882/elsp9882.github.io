## Bio
I was raised in Castle Rock, Colorado. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I studied mathematics and philosophy. My master's degree is in economics from the University of Texas at Austin. I'm heading into my fourth year of a PhD in economics at the University of Washington in Seattle. 

## Academic Interests

Within the field of economics, I'm interested in macroeconomics. Specifically, I'm interested in monetary economics, international finance, and macro-finance. I've been conducting research on monetary policy matters for the last few years, and I've recently begun to delve into the fiscal theory of the price level, a theory that one of my professors once told me "seems insane," but which interests me as a potential explanatory mechanism for historical cyclical patterns that might prove superior to more mainstream approaches.

Although economics is my main academic interest, it wasn't my first love as a discipline; that would be philosophy. I'm particularly enamored with philosophy of religion. I wrote an honors thesis as an undergraduate at CU Boulder, where I defended a particular formulation of Divine Command Theory. I still read philosophy, and in addition to philosophy of religion, I enjoy reading about epistemology, existentialism, and political philosophy. Some of my favorite philosophers are Thomas Aquinas, Michael Huemer (one of my college professors), SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, and Alvin Plantinga.

Besides English, I also speak German fluently and have been studying it for about ten years. One of the virtues of knowing German is being able to read authors like Bonhoeffer, Kant, and Nietzsche in their native language and to understand the lyrics of great classical music pieces. I keep up with it by reading German news articles and listening to podcasts.

I also enjoy reading history, especially biographies, as well as works related to political science.

## Hobbies

When I have the time, I enjoy playing music. I've played guitar most of my life, and I acquired a keyboard a few years back, on which I've learned a few riffs (I'm not very good at the latter, but I enjoy it). 

I also love the outdoors. The picture at the top of this page is of me at the summit of North Maroon Peak in Aspen, CO. I've climbed several of the "14ers" in Colorado and try to "bag" one of them each year. 

I live in Bellevue, WA with my wonderful wife Kendall.
