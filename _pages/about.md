## Bio
I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I double-majored in mathematics and philosophy. My master's degree is in economics from the University of Texas at Austin. I'm currently a fourth-year PhD candidate in economics at the University of Washington in Seattle. I advanced to doctoral candidacy in June of 2025.

## Academic Interests

Within the field of economics, I'm interested in macroeconomics. Specifically, I'm interested in monetary economics, international finance, and macro-finance. I've been conducting research on monetary policy matters for the last few years, and I'm currently working on research related to the fiscal theory of the price level.

In addition to economics, I enjoy reading about political science, law, history (especially biographies), and philosophy.

Besides English, I also speak German fluently and have been studying it for about ten years.

## Hobbies

When I have the time, I enjoy playing music. I've played guitar most of my life.

I also love the outdoors. The picture at the top of this page was taken at the summit of North Maroon Peak in Aspen, CO. I've climbed several of the "14ers" in Colorado and try to "bag" one of them each year. 

I live in Bellevue, WA with my wonderful wife Kendall.
