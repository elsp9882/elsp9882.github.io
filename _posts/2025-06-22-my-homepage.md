Here you will find the current research projects I am engaged in as well as other materials such as links to my social media, personal information, as well as my opinions and reflections on various matters. The views expressed on this website are entirely my own and do not indicate concurrence either by the University of Washington or its economics department. 

Under "Projects," you can access my working papers in economics. 

Under "Opinions," you will find a variety of pieces that I have written regarding political and religious issues. Although I frequently wander outside of my field in assessing many of these issues, I always do my best to research matters thoroughly before providing my assessment. I don't pretend to be an expert in anything outside of economics and I only voice my opinion regarding political matters that I have spent considerable time researching as a layman. Any factual errors are unintentional as I simply aim to convey the truth as I see it.

The "About" tab contains personal information about myself.
